		<h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
		<p>I believe that we are unique, with unique bodies, thoughts, feelings and identities.
			People go to great lengths to celebrate their individuality.
			I help companies profit from new mass-customization technologies.
			Is your company actively pursuing this market?</p>
		<p>Dannielle (my buddy) thinks my elevator pitch should be like this:</p>
		<p>Hi my name is Marty I believe in being unique in all aspects of our lives.
			By treating everyone as a unique individual, I am able to help make them custom products.
			People deserve to have/use/wear products that celebrate the fact that they are one of a kind.
			Do like when you are able to express yourself?</p>
		<p>I like aspects of it and want to kick it around a bit.</p>
